## A Chrome extension to open a chess.com game in lichess.org's analysis. ##

This extension extends the work of Allan Rempel who created a similar plugin for chess.com v2. This extension has the following additional features:

* Supports chess.com v3 (new chess.com) and v2 (old chess.com)
* Works from the Game Archive as well as from finished live games
* Automatically toggles the new 'computer analysis' check box on the lichess.org import page.
